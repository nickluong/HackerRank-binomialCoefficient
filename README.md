In mathematics, binomial coefficients are a family of positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem.  

denotes the number of ways of choosing k objects from n different objects.
However when n and k are too large, we often save them after modulo operation by a prime number P. Please calculate how many binomial coefficients of n become to 0 after modulo by P.
